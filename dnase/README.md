# BamToBigWig function for DNase-I-seq data
Takes bam files from DNase-I sequencing data as input and writes plus and minus strand bigWig files as output to the user-assigned output-dir.

## Dependencies: 

The pipelines depend on several common bioinformatics tools: 
- [ ] samtools (http://www.htslib.org/download/)
- [ ] bedtools (http://bedtools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)
- [ ] bedGraphToBigWig (from the Kent source utilities http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/admin/exe/)

Please make sure you can call the bioinformatics tools from your current working directory.
